## Description

## Description
This ia a simple app to help create cards for your work team. Options are Manager, Engineer, and Intern. This app will help to keep all employee contact info in one convenient location. This project was fun to make and I learned a lot about Object Oriented Programming in the process!

## Installation
To install this app, clone this repository from GitHub. Once you've cloned it, open it in the integrated terminal and type the command "node index.js". You will be prompted several questions, and when you have answered them, choose "I am finished", then open your sample.html in the browser!
